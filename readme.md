### REQUIRES PHP 7.4+

User synthetics (USS) is a free and open source user management software solution developed in PHP and MYSQL. It is 100% object oriented system designed to help web developers simplify the process of creating basic required user management features such as login, registration, reset password, user dashboard and admin panels.

User synthetics gives you the absolute advantage to focus precisely on the significant part of your project without worrying or wasting time on user experience or user interface development. The system is so powerful that it gives you total tendency to recreate or modify any part of the interface or access controls by simply creating or installing extensions or plugins.

User synthetics provides out of the box classes and variables that you can use to do amazing things in one shot which you would have done by writing bunch of codes. The system is built using Bootstrap 5 and Font-Awesome 5 frameworks. Thus, making it easy for you to customize the user or admin panels to your own taste. It also includes JQuery and Vue.js library and provides a default USS based object with extremely useful and easily accessible methods. Together, you have reliable packages that will help you build a web application faster and comfortably.

User synthetics is so simplified that it gives you greater opportunity to build up an entirely different custom interface and to easily manage backend scripts without even touching the main code or the system script files. Most interestingly, user synthetics has an anti-spam class that filters user input and block further processes that are sent from spam bots trying to submit automated form data.

The system is fully user oriented. Hence, it can be used to build technologies such as forum, loan app, social network, business system, employee management platform and anything you can think of that relates to management of user data. User synthetics has no procedural function. All callables are class methods. Thus, making it totally object oriented.
